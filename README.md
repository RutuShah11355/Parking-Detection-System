# Parking-Detection-System
Parking spot detection system using openCV image processing and computer vision in python3.

I have used Python3 and OpenCV in this project.
The YAML Library is used to plot the X & Y cordinates on the video.

To run this program use the python/main.py and for X & Y cordinates use dataset/final.yml


If you want to use this for a video then change the parameter of cv2.VideoCapture to fn variable i.e. "cap = cv2.VideoCapture(fn)"
and for a live camera feed you can change it to "0" for inbuilt camera of laptop and "1" for externam camera.
